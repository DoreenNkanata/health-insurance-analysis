# Health Insurance and Cancer Screening Data Analysis

This project explores access to health insurance and cancer screening services among different groups in the population based on marital status, age, gender, and employment status. The analysis was conducted as part of a data science learning journey.

## Project Objectives

- Understand how health insurance access varies by marital and employment status
- Explore cancer screening behavior across gender and age groups
- Visualize patterns and disparities in health access

## Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Data visualization
- CSV data

## Key Insights

- Married individuals are more likely to have health insurance than single or divorced people.
- Employed individuals have significantly higher insurance coverage than unemployed groups.
- Cancer screening rates increase with age and are generally higher among females than males.
